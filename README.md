### Description

Download files from KaZaa users without having to be connected to the KaZaa network. Features include: Search, Browsing, Download queue, etc. Currently only downloades one file at a time but you can add multiple files to a queue so that they will be downloaded automatically. You also have the ability to send KuDos to the system try while downloading. I used the IP Scanner code from James (A little buggy but thanks | http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=32384&lngWId=1) and I used the Downloader OCX provided by Sean (Awsome code! | http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=23693&lngWId=1). I also used a Tray Icon Module (can't remember where I got it :( sorry). Could be improved by adding a faster search, multiple download's, etc. Oh Ya, Please vote `,:0)
 
### More Info
 
I have included all icons/bas modules with zip. Might need to download the Downloader OCX which can be found here: http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=23693&lngWId=1
